        <i></i> Why Maaya ko Thaal?
      </h2>
      <h3>3.1 million children death per year => Under Nutrition</h3>
      <p class="lead">As per UNICEF report, Poor nutrition in the first 1,000 days of a child’s life can lead to stunted growth, which is associated with impaired cognitive ability and reduced school and work performance.Therefore, we wanted for an innovative,calibrated solution to this which could monitor the nutrition intake and enforce parents not to compromise on diets reminding them daily and the result is Maaya ko Thaal</p>

      <h3>Impact we wish to create</h3>
      <p class="lead">Lack of knowledge in mothers about the adequate nutrition intake and balanced diet for their children adds to the problem of undernutrition.On top of that with growing urbanization and easy availability of packaged food, a proportion of calories in children’s diets is being taken up by junk foods.</p ><p class="lead">
        Hence, we came up with our design 'Maaya Ko Thaal' targeting the problems of low/middle-income families where the problem of food insecurity is high. We intend to ensure that the child will be getting the minimum amount of food to fulfill his/her nutrition requirement level. We hope to address the problems in families where basic food is available but still, the problem of malnutrition prevails due to a lack of knowledge about food size and proportion.We hope to create awareness among mothers about the importance of proper nutrition for her child, the basic need of every child.

      <h3>Larger insights into Maaya ko Thaal</h3>
      <p class="lead">Maaya ko Thaal is a eating plate with markings for the required per serving amount of cooked rice, dal (legumes), vegetables, and milk (staple Nepali food) for children from age 1 to 6 years. This is a user-friendly self-monitoring tool which the mothers can use to measure the amount of calories and nutrients she should be providing her child per meal. Hence it provides a guide to the mothers so that she can provide sufficient minimum nutrients to her child even in the face of limited resources.
The plate contains compartments specified for proportion sizes of different food to ensure that all the nutrients required by the child are included for a balanced diet. The compartments are aimed to cover the required carbohydrate, protein, vitamins, and minerals like calcium. Hence it reinforces the necessity of including a variety of food in the child's diet.</p>
<p class="lead">The heart-shaped design of the plate epitomizes the mother’s love and attracts children.When children are provided with their personal eating plate with a unique design, they tend to develop a sense of attachment to it. This helps to encourage children to eat homemade healthy meal on their plate rather than getting distracted by junk food.
The product is user friendly and is simple enough for uneducated mothers to use. The caretaker needs to serve the cooked food filling the markings given in the plate according to the child’s age. The child can directly eat from the measurement plate.</p>
<p class="lead" >Our vision is to collaborate with the government and organizations to distribute the product for free (or at minimal cost) through health posts where children come for their 12 months immunization. It would be nice to incorporate it within our culture as "Pahilo Janmadin ko Upahar" (First Birthday Gift). A gift of proper nutrition and good health would be the most precious for a child.

          <h2>A glimpse of our story</h2>
          <p>
             COVID period has been hard for all of us and especially, children are more prone to all the infectious disease that may come up any time in the post-covid period as well. Right nutrition, healthy growth and strong immunity can only help them to be prepared for any infections upcoming further. Therefore, to not only tackle with 3.1 million children death per year with undernutrition but to as well prepare them for post covid period, Maaya ko Thaal is innovation driven well calibrated solution. 

          </p>
          We tested our prototype among the families in 2 places ie. Sinamangal Slum Area and Bode, Bhaktapur. Plates were given to 10 mothers and their feedback was taken after 2 weeks. Let's see how Maaya ko Thaal has helped them to stick to a routine of right nutrition to their child.
